# Your great project
Every great project starts with a little documentation!

## Installation
Some descriptive instructions...

then some lists of important steps...
- one step
- at a time

and perhaps a little bit of code...
```
bash clarify.sh
```

## Requirements
Whatever your app needs in order to run (environment variables, configuration file etc)

## Usage
Just a couple of examples of how would someone other than you find this useful
